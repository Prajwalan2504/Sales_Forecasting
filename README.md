# Sales_Forecasting

## Project Description

This project aims to forecast sales for a retail store using historical data and machine learning models. The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results to provide actionable business insights.

## Data Sources

The project utilizes the following datasets:

- `train.csv`: Historical sales data for training the models.
- `test.csv`: Data for evaluating model performance.
- `stores.csv`: Information about the stores.
- `oil.csv`: Daily oil prices.
- `holidays_events.csv`: Information about holidays and events.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

3. **Install required libraries:**

## Running the Notebook

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

2. **Run all cells:**
   Execute all cells in the notebook sequentially to load data, perform feature engineering, train models, evaluate performance, and visualize results.

## Model Comparison Summary

This project compares the performance of several time series forecasting models, including:

- Baseline (Na√Øve Forecasting)
- ARIMA
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LSTM
- Prophet (optional)

The model evaluation metrics used are RMSE, MAPE, and R-squared. The results are summarized in the notebook and in a separate file (if provided).

## Key Insights

The project provides insights into the influence of external factors (holidays, oil prices, promotions) on sales and suggests business strategies for improving sales forecasting, such as inventory planning and targeted promotions.
